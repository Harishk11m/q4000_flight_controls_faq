                    <p>The FCECU will depressurize a faulty PCU, and if one PCU fails, it will increase the pressure to the operating PCU. It also sends signals to the rudder caution lights and pushoff switchlights to indicate system malfunctions.</p>

                <summary><h3>1. What is the main purpose of the ground spoilers system?</h3></summary>
                <div class="question-content">
                    <p>The ground spoilers are deployed symmetrically to "dump" the lift created by the wings. This puts all of the aircraft's weight on the landing gear, making the wheel brakes more effective for slowing the aircraft.</p>

                <div class="question-content">
                    <p>Ground Mode operation occurs when the Proximity Sensor Electronic Unit (PSEU) gives the Weight-On-Wheels (WOW) signal to the Flight Control Electronic Control Unit (FCECU), power levers 1 and 2 are set to less than 12 degrees above flight idle, and the spoiler FLIGHT/TAXI switch is in the FLIGHT position.</p>

                <div class="question-content">
                    <p>When the ground spoilers are extended, the ROLL INBD and ROLL OUTBD advisory lights come on. The wing lift is "dumped," which increases the weight on the landing gear to give maximum braking efficiency.</p>

                <div class="question-content">
                    <p>If a solenoid valve fails to energize, the inboard or outboard ground spoilers will not extend. The applicable ROLL SPLR INBD GND or ROLL SPLR OUTBD GND caution light will come on after a time delay of 5 seconds.</p>

                <div class="question-content">
                    <p>If a go-around is necessary, the pilot advances the power levers. This removes power to the lift dump solenoid valves and the roll advisory lights. All spoiler panels will retract, and the roll advisory lights will go off.</p>

                <div class="question-content">
                    <p>The two valves in each system are connected hydraulically in series. Both valves must open to let pressure through to the related spoiler PCU. This reduces the possibility of accidental in-flight symmetric deployment.</p>

                    <p>The flaps are electronically controlled and hydraulically operated. The flap quadrant on the center console has five positions corresponding to the five possible flap positions: 0°, 5°, 10°, 15°, and 35°.</p>
